# Covid Fighter In The UK

The premise of my game is that the covid virus has mutated and turned people into zombies. The setting for the game location takes place in the UK where a surviving UK officer must take down all the zombies to stop the spreading of the virus.

The game was made by following a tile based game tutorial and is based on this tutorial's code. The attribution for the tutorial used is linked below.

## How to Run:
You can run the game either by running the covidWorking.exe file or by opening up the terminal. If you are trying to run the game from terminal you must ensure you are in the correct directory. The source code and executable must be inside the dpnx39 folder but not in any of the subfolders. You must ensure that all resource files are within the Resources subfolder. You then type in "python covidWorking.py", "python3 covidWorking.py" or "covidWorking.py" without the quotation marks and press enter.

## Gameplay and Controls:
You can navigate the menu by using the **UP** and **DOWN** arrow keys and then select the difficulty by pressing **ENTER**. You can control the player by using the arrows keys and shoot by pressing **SPACE**. You can exit the game by pressing **ESCAPE** on the keyboard or by pressing the **X** button at the top right of the window.

## Known Bugs

- Missing Mobs when taking too long to select difficulty, try select a difficulty as quick as you can or restart the game.
- Missing mobs when going to new level, try pick a power up quickly otherwise restart the game.
- Mobs appear very close when taking too long to select an option from the menu, not too bad as you can just die to restart the level.
